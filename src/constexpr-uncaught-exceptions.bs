Abstract: This paper marks `std::uncaught_exceptions` and `std::current_exception` `constexpr`.
</pre>


# Overview # {#overview}

I propose to mark the function `std::uncaught_exceptions` `constexpr`.

Currently, this can be done because there can never be an active exception during constant evaluation.
`std::uncaught_exceptions` would always return zero during constant evaluation.
Similarly, `std::current_exception` would always return a null pointer.

[[P2996R1]] recommends exceptions as an error handling mechanism for reflections,
during constant evaluation.
If exceptions were throwable in constant expresssions, marking these functions `constexpr`
would simply be part of exception support.
<b>However, [[P2996R1]] is not a prerequisite to this proposal.</b>


# Motivation # {#motivation}

The motivation is the same as allowing `try`-`catch` blocks in `constexpr` functions,
a feature added to C++20 thanks to [[P1002R1]].
Allowing the use of `uncaught_exceptions()` in constant expressions makes
metaprogramming easier and eliminates special `if consteval` cases.

A common use case for `std::uncaught_exceptions` is in the implementation of RAII types which
execute a function upon destruction, but only if an exception was (not) thrown in the current
scope.
This is utilized by `std::scope_success` and `std::scope_failure`; see [[N4806]].

For example, in the implementation of a `constexpr` stack, one may write:
```cpp
constexpr value_type pop() {
    // Only decrease the size of the stack if no exception was thrown during
    // copy/move construction of the returned object.
    // This ensures a strong exception guarantee.
    std::scope_success _{[this] { m_size--; }};
    return std::move(top());
}
```
It is reasonable to mark such code `constexpr`, and ideally `std::uncaught_exceptions` would not be an
obstacle to this.

Furthermore, it makes sense to mark `std::uncaught_exceptions`' sister function,
`std::current_exception` `constexpr`.
This is done purely for the purpose of consistency.
I am not aware of any concrete example of `std::current_exception`'s
lack of `constexpr` being an obstacle.


# Possible implementation # {#possible-implementation}

## `constexpr uncaught_exceptions` ## {#constexpr-uncaught-exceptions}

```cpp
constexpr int uncaught_exceptions() noexcept {
    if consteval {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return __uncaught_exceptions_impl();
    }
}
```

It is obviously possible for the user to wrap `std::uncaught_exceptions`
like this themselves (e.g. [[ScopeLite]]), but this is an unnecessary burden.

## `constexpr current_exception` ## {#constexpr-current-exception}

```cpp
constexpr exception_ptr current_exception() noexcept {
    if consteval {
        return exception_ptr(nullptr);
    } else {
        return __current_exception_impl();
    }
}
```

## `constexpr` `exception_ptr` ## {#constexpr-exception-ptr}

`std::exception_ptr` would also need to be made a literal type.
All major three standard libraries implement `exception_ptr` as a wrapper class for `void*`,
which makes this easily possible.

- See [libc++, exception_ptr.h](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/__exception/exception_ptr.h).
- See [libstdc++, eh_ptr.cc](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/eh_ptr.cc).
- See [MSVC STL, exception](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/main/stl/inc/exception).

Simply mark all special member functions `constexpr` and if necessary, guard their implementation
with an `if !consteval` block.
It is impossible to create an `exception_ptr` that is not a null pointer during constant
evaluations.


## Non-trivial implementations ## {#non-trivial-implementations}

[[P2996R1]] suggests allowing `throw` in constant expressions.
This would mean that `std::active_exceptions`, `std::current_exception`,
and `std::exception_ptr` would no longer have such trivial implementations,
and further functions such as `std::make_exception_ptr` may be marked `constexpr`.

The bare minimum compiler support needed for this is:

1. The compiler must track all active exceptions "magically", so that
    `std::active_exceptions()` returns the correct amount.
    Alternatively, the mentioned functions need to access a global counter of active exceptions.
    This requires some form of `int& __builtin_get_exception_counter()`.

2. `std::exception_ptr` behaves like a type-erased, reference-counted smart pointer.
    [[P2738R1]] has been accepted into C++26, adding `constexpr` cast from `void*`.
    This makes the implementation of such type-erasure in `constexpr std::exception_ptr` feasible.


# Proposed wording # {#proposed-wording}

del {

    color: inherit;
    text-decoration: strikethrough;
}
</style>

The proposed changes are relative to the working draft of the standard as of [[!N4917]].

Update subclause 17.3.2 [version.syn], paragraph 2 as follows:

<blockquote>
<code><pre>#define __cpp_lib_constexpr_current_exception       <ins>202401L</ins> // freestanding, also in &lt;exception&gt;</pre></code>
[...]
<code><pre>#define __cpp_lib_uncaught_exceptions               <del>201411L</del><ins>202401L</ins> // freestanding, also in &lt;exception&gt;</pre></code>
</blockquote>

Update subclause 17.9.6 [uncaught.exceptions] as follows:

<blockquote>
<code><pre><ins>constexpr</ins> int uncaught_exceptions() noexcept;</pre></code>
</blockquote>

Update subclause 17.9.7 [propagation], paragraph 2 as follows:

<blockquote>
`exception_ptr` <ins>is a literal type([basic.types.general])</ins>
which meets the requirements of *Cpp17NullablePointer* (Table 36).
<ins>All expressions which must be valid for a *Cpp17NullablePointer*
are constant expressions for a null value of type `exception_ptr`.</ins>
</blockquote>

Note: This wording is slightly work-in-progress.

Update subclause 17.9.7 [propagation], `current_exception` as follows:

<blockquote>
<code><pre><ins>constexpr</ins> exception_ptr current_exception() noexcept;</pre></code>
</blockquote>
