\abstract{
The \tcode{std::integral} concept includes
cv-qualified types, character types, and \tcode{bool},
which is overly broad for many uses cases.
More restrictive concepts are introduced,
and editorial changes are made so "integral" and "integer" are distinct terms.

\h2{Introduction}

\tcode{std::integral} is widely used by the C++ community
as a constraint for numeric code (\ref[GitHubSearch]).
Many of these uses are questionable because \tcode{std::integral} is satisfied by
character types such as \tcode{char}, as well as \tcode{bool},
and cv-qualified versions of all these types.

\bug{
The constraints on the following template
most likely don't match the intent of the author.
\cppblock{
template <std::integral T>
T add_integers(T x, T y) { return x + y; }
// ...
add_integers(true, true);      // OK?!
add_integers('a', 'b');        // OK?!
add_integers<const int>(1, 2); // OK?!
}
}

The C++ standard uses "signed or unsigned integer type" as a more appropriate constraint
in \eelis{numeric.sat.func}, \eelis{mdspan.extents.overview}, and various other subclauses.

I propose to formalize this wording idiom in the form of a
\integer concept (name is tentative, could change).
The goal is mainly to provide a simple alternative to \tcode{std::integral}
which provides more appropriate constraints in user code.

\h2{Design}

The C++ standard currently uses "integer" and "integral" in a surprising way.
\tcode{std::signed_integral} includes types that are not signed integers,
\tcode{std::unsigned_integral} includes types that are not unsigned integers,
but "integer type" is a synonym for "integral type"
(\eelis{basic.fundamental#def:integer_type}).

The really confusing part is that "integral" is only sometimes, but not always,
a broader term than "integer".
This can be improved with the following strategy:

\table{
\tr{
    \th{Defined term (if any)}
    \th{\tcode{concept}}
    \th{Meaning}
}
\tr{
    \td{integral type}
    \td{\tcode{std::integral}}
    \td{Lots of stuff: \tcode{int}, \tcode{char}, \tcode{const bool}, ...}
}
\tr{
    \td{N/A}
    \td{\tcode{std::signed_integral}}
    \td{integral types which satisfy \tcode{std::is_signed_v}}
}
\tr{
    \td{N/A}
    \td{\tcode{std::unsigned_integral}}
    \td{integral types which do not satisfy \tcode{std::is_signed_v}}
}
\tr{
    \td{\del{integer type}}
    \td{\del{\tcode{std::integral}}}
    \td{\del{synonym for integral type}}
}
\tr{
    \td{\ins{integer type}}
    \td{\ins{\tcode{std::integer}}}
    \td{\ins{signed or unsigned integer types}}
}
\tr{
    \td{signed integer type}
    \td{\ins{\tcode{std::signed_integer}}}
    \td{\tcode{signed char}, \tcode{signed short}, \tcode{signed int}, etc.\br(also extended signed integers)}
}
\tr{
    \td{unsigned integer type}
    \td{\ins{\tcode{std::unsigned_integer}}}
    \td{\tcode{unsigned char}, \tcode{unsigned short}, \tcode{unsigned int}, etc.\br(also extended unsigned integers)}
}
}

\note{
With this new strategy,
\tcode{char} and \tcode{bool} are not integer types, but integral types.
}

Some alternative designs instead of \integer were considered:
\ul{
\item{
\tcode{std::signed_or_unsigned} would be inappropriate
because \tcode{std::is_signed_v<float>} is \tcode{true}.
}
\item{
\tcode{std::signed_or_unsigned_integer} is comically verbose.
It would also perpetuate the "signed or unsigned integer" workaround in wording;
we ought to have a simpler name.
}
\item{
\tcode{std::real_integer}, \tcode{std::actual_integer}, \tcode{std::integral2},
and other such "integers but like, for real this time" names
aren't any less confusing than \integer{}.
}
}

\h3{Is this obsoleted by P3003?}

\ref[P3003] goes into a different direction:
creating a whole library of numeric concepts,
which would also include user-defined types (via opt-in).

However, a lot of numeric user code would not be robust enough to take \em{any type}
that behaves like an integer mathematically.
User code that is currently constrained with \tcode{std::integral<T>}
likely makes some assumptions about \tcode{T}, like
\ul{
\item{expressions of type \tcode{T} can be used in a \tcode{switch}, as an array index, etc.,}
\item{\tcode{T} is trivially copyable and usually small,}
\item{\tcode{T} is default-constructible,}
\item{no operation can throw, terminate, etc.,}
\item{\tcode{T} can be converted to floating-point types, among other things,}
\item{...}
}

\integer is a quick way to constrain a function while documenting these assumptions,
which is needed in practice.

\h2{Impact on the standard}

Firstly, the three new concepts \tcode{std::integer},
\tcode{std::signed_integer}, and \tcode{std::unsigned_integer} are added.

Secondly, we make editorial changes
so that "integer" is consistently a narrower term,
and "integral" is a broader term.
See \ref[#design].

While the changes are all very simple,
the wording impact is quite immense because "integer" and "integral"
have been used interchangeably throughout wording.
Any existing uses of "integer" are replaced with "integral",
and the "signed or unsigned integer" pattern can be simplified to just "integer".

\h2{Wording}

\style{
ins-block .para::before {
    display: none;
}

.stable-ref {
    float: right;
}
}

The following changes are relative to \ref[N5008].

\h3{Core wording}

Change \eelis{basic.fundamental#5} as follows:

\diff{
Each value \math{\mi{x}} of an unsigned integer type with width \math{\mi{N}} has
a unique representation \math{\mrow{
    \mi{x}
    \mo{=}
    \msub{\mi{x}\mn{0}}
    \msup{\mn{2}\mn{0}}
    \mo{+}
    \msub{\mi{x}\mn{1}}
    \msup{\mn{2}\mn{1}}
    \mo{+}
    \mo{\c{mldr}}
    \mo{+}
    \msub{\mi{x}\mrow{\mi{N}\mo{-}\mn{1}}}
    \msup{\mn{2}\mrow{\mi{N}\mo{-}\mn{1}}}
}},
where each coefficient \math{\msub{\mi{x}\mi{i}}} is either 0 or 1;
this is called the \i{base-2 representation} of \math{\mi{x}}.
The base-2 representation of a value of signed integer type is
the base-2 representation of the congruent value
of the corresponding unsigned integer type.
The standard signed integer types and standard unsigned integer types
are collectively called the \i{standard integer types}, and the extended
signed integer types and extended
unsigned integer types are collectively called the
\i{extended integer types}.
\ins{The standard integer types and extended integer types
are collectively called \i{integer types}.
\br\wg21-note{
The set of integer types is equal to
the set of signed and unsigned integer types.
}}
}

\note{
If you cannot see the mathematical symbols in the paragraph above,
you are viewing this document in an old browser with no MathML support.
}

Change \eelis{basic.fundamental#6} as follows:

\diff{
A fundamental type specified to have
\del{a signed or unsigned} \ins{an} integer type as its \i{underlying type} has
the same object representation,
value representation,
alignment requirements\iref{basic.align}, and
range of representable values as the underlying type.
Further, each value has the same representation in both types.
}

Change \eelis{basic.fundamental#8} as follows:

\diff{
Type \tcode{wchar_t} is a distinct type that has
an implementation-defined
\del{signed or unsigned} integer type as its underlying type.
}

Change \eelis{basic.fundamental#11} as follows:

\diff{
The types \tcode{char}, \tcode{wchar_t}, \tcode{char8_t}, \tcode{char16_t}, and \tcode{char32_t}
are collectively called \i{character types}.
The character types,
\ins{integer types},
\tcode{bool},
\del{the signed and unsigned integer types,}
and cv-qualified versions (\eelis{basic.type.qualifier}) thereof,
are collectively \del{termed} \ins{called} \i{integral types}.
\del{A synonym for integral type is \i{integer type}.}
}

Change \eelis{conv.rank#1} as follows:

\diff{
Every \del{integer type} \ins{integral type}
has an \i{\del{integer} \ins{integral} conversion rank} defined as follows:
\ul{
\item{[\c{mldr}]}
\item{
The rank of any extended signed integer type
relative to another extended signed integer type
with the same width is implementation-defined,
but still subject to the other rules
for determining the \del{integer} \ins{integral} conversion rank.
}
\item{
For all \del{integer} \ins{integral} types \tcode{T1}, \tcode{T2}, and \tcode{T3},
if \tcode{T1} has greater rank than \tcode{T2}\ins{,}
and \tcode{T2} has greater rank than \tcode{T3},
then \tcode{T1} has greater rank than \tcode{T3}.
}
}
\wg21-note{
The \del{integer} \ins{integral} conversion rank is used
in the definition of the integral promotion (\eelis{conv.prom})
and the usual arithmetic conversions (\eelis{expr.arith.conv}).
}
}

\note{
Notice that a comma is inserted within the last bullet.
}

Change \eelis{conv.lval#3.5} as follows:

\diff{
Otherwise, the object indicated by the glvalue is read (\eelis{defns.access}).
Let \tcode{V} be the value contained in the object.
If \tcode{T} is an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type,
the prvalue result is
the value of type \tcode{T} congruent (\eelis{basic.fundamental}) to \tcode{V}, and
\tcode{V} otherwise.
}

Change \eelis{conv.prom#2} as follows:

\diff{
A prvalue that is not a converted bit-field and has an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type other than
\tcode{bool}, \tcode{char8_t}, \tcode{char16_t},
\tcode{char32_t}, or \tcode{wchar_t} whose \del{integer} \ins{integral} conversion
rank (\eelis{conv.rank}) is less than the rank of \tcode{int} can be
converted to a prvalue of type \tcode{int} if \tcode{int} can represent
all the values of the source type; otherwise, the source prvalue can be
converted to a prvalue of type \tcode{unsigned int}.
}

Change \eelis{conv.prom#3} as follows:

\diff{
A prvalue of an unscoped enumeration type whose underlying type is not
fixed can be converted to a prvalue of the first of the following
types that can represent all the values of the enumeration (\eelis{dcl.enum}):
\tcode{int}, \tcode{unsigned int}, \tcode{long int}, \tcode{unsigned long int},
\tcode{long long int}, or \tcode{unsigned long long int}.
If none of the types in that
list can represent all the values of the enumeration, a prvalue of an unscoped
enumeration type can be converted to a prvalue of the extended integer type with lowest
\del{integer} \ins{integral} conversion rank (\eelis{conv.rank})
greater than the rank of \tcode{long long}
in which all the values of the enumeration can be represented.
If there are two such extended types,
the signed one is chosen.
}

Change \eelis{conv.integral#1} as follows:

\diff{
A prvalue of an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type
can be converted to a prvalue of another \del{integer} \ins{integral} type.
A prvalue of an unscoped enumeration type
can be converted to a prvalue of an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type.
}

Change \eelis{conv.fpint#1} as follows:

\diff{
A prvalue of a floating-point type can be converted to a prvalue of an
\del{integer} \ins{integral} type.
The conversion truncates;
that is, the fractional part is discarded.
The behavior is undefined if the truncated value cannot be represented
in the destination type.
}

Change \eelis{conv.fpint#2} as follows:

\diff{
A prvalue of an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type
or of an unscoped enumeration type
can be converted to
a prvalue of a floating-point type.
[\c{mldr}]
}

Change \eelis{expr.reinterpret.cast#5} as follows:

\diff{
A value of integral type or enumeration type
can be explicitly converted to a pointer.
A pointer converted to an \del{integer} \ins{integral type} of sufficient size
(if any such exists on the implementation)
and back to the same pointer type
will have its original value (\eelis{basic.compound});
mappings between pointers and \del{integers} \ins{integral types} are otherwise
implementation-defined.
}

Change \eelis{expr.assign#2} as follows:

\diff{
In simple assignment (\tcode{=}),
let \tcode{V} be the result of the right operand;
the object referred to by the left operand is
modified\iref{defns.access} by replacing its value
with \tcode{V} or,
if the object is of \del{integer} \ins{integral} type,
with the value congruent\iref{basic.fundamental} to \tcode{V}.
}

Change \eelis{dcl.init.list#7} as follows:

\diff{
A \i{narrowing conversion} is an implicit conversion
\ul{
\item{from a floating-point type to an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type, or}
\item{[\c{mldr}]}
\item{
from an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type or unscoped enumeration type to a floating-point type, except
where the source is a constant expression and the actual value after conversion will fit
into the target type and will produce the original value when converted back to the
original type, or
}
\item{
from an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type or unscoped enumeration type
to an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type that cannot represent all the
values of the original type, except where [\c{mldr}]
}
\item{
[\c{mldr}]
}
}
}

Change \eelis{dcl.enum#11} as follows:

\diff{
The value of an enumerator or an object of an unscoped enumeration type is
converted to an \del{integer} \ins{integral type} by integral promotion\iref{conv.prom}.
}

Change \eelis{class.bit#4} as follows:

\diff{
If a value of integral type (other than \tcode{bool}) is stored
into a bit-field of width \math{\mi{N}} and the value would be representable
in a hypothetical \del{signed or unsigned} integer type
with width \math{\mi{N}} and the same signedness as the bit-field's type,
the original value and the value of the bit-field compare equal.
[\c{mldr}]
}

\h3{Library wording}

Change \eelis{bitmask.types#1} as follows:

\diff{
Several types defined in \eelis{support} through \eelis{exec} and \eelis{depr} are bitmask types.
Each bitmask type can be implemented
as an enumerated type that overloads certain operators, as an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type,
or as a bitset.
}

Change \eelis{support.types.layout} as follows:

\diff{
\recommended
An implementation should choose types for \tcode{ptrdiff_t} and \tcode{size_t}
whose \del{integer} \ins{integral} conversion ranks\iref{conv.rank} are no greater than that of
\tcode{signed long int} unless a larger size is necessary to contain all the possible values.

in the same style as more recent wording in \eelis{numerics.c.ckdint}.
}

Change \eelis{mdspan.sub.helpers#1}
and \eelis{mdspan.sub.helpers#10}
as follows:

\diff{
\mandates
\tcode{IndexType}
\del{is a signed or unsigned integer type}
\ins{models \tcode{integer}}.
}

Change \eelis{ranges.syn#1} as follows:

\diff{
Within this Clause,
for an integer-like type \tcode{X}\iref{iterator.concept.winc},
\tcode{\exposid{make-unsigned-like-t}<X>} denotes
\tcode{make_unsigned_t<X>} if \tcode{X} is an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type;
otherwise, it denotes a corresponding unspecified unsigned-integer-like type
of the same width as \tcode{X}.
For an expression \tcode{x} of type \tcode{X},
\tcode{\exposid{to-unsigned-like}(x)} is
\tcode{x} explicitly converted to
\tcode{\exposid{make-unsigned-like-t}<X>}.
}

Change \eelis{ranges.syn#2} as follows:

\diff{
Also within this Clause,
\tcode{\exposid{make-signed-like-t}<X>} for an integer-like type \tcode{X}
denotes \tcode{make_signed_t<X>} if \tcode{X} is an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type;
otherwise, it denotes a corresponding unspecified signed-integer-like type
of the same width as \tcode{X}.
}

Change \eelis{numeric.ops.gcd#1} and
\eelis{numeric.ops.lcm#1} as follows:

\diff{
\mandates
\tcode{M} and \tcode{N} both are \del{integer} \ins{integral} types other than \tcode{bool}.
}

Change \eelis{numeric.ops.midpoint#1} as follows:

\diff{
\returns
Half the sum of \tcode{a} and \tcode{b}.
If \tcode{T} is an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type and the sum is odd,
the result is rounded towards \tcode{a}.
}

In \eelis{numeric.sat.func},
change paragraphs 2, 4, 6, and 8 as follows:

\diff{
\constraints
\tcode{T}
\del{is a signed or unsigned integer type ([basic.fundamental])}
\ins{models \tcode{integer}}.
}

Change \eelis{numeric.sat.cast#1} as follows:

\diff{
\constraints
\tcode{R} and \tcode{T}
\del{are signed or unsigned integer types ([basic.fundamental])}
\ins{model \tcode{integer}}.
}

Change \eelis{charconv.syn#1} as follows:

\diff{
When a function is specified
with a type placeholder of \placeholder{integer-type},
the implementation provides overloads
for \tcode{char} and all \del{cv-unqualified signed and unsigned integer} \ins{integer} types
in lieu of \placeholder{integer-type}.
When a function is specified
with a type placeholder of \placeholder{floating-point-type},
the implementation provides overloads
for all cv-unqualified floating-point types\iref{basic.fundamental}
in lieu of \placeholder{floating-point-type}.
}

\note{
Signed or unsigned integer types are already cv-unqualified;
this wording used to be redundant.
}

Change \eelis{format.string.std#10} as follows:

\diff{
If \tt{{ \exposid{arg-id}\sub{\serif{opt}} }} is used in a \grammarterm{width or precision} option,
the value of the corresponding formatting argument
is used as the value of the option.
The option is valid only if the corresponding formatting argument
is of \del{signed or unsigned} integer type.
If its value is negative, an exception of type \tcode{format_error} is thrown.
}

Change \eelis{cmplx.over#2.2} as follows:

\diff{
Otherwise, if the argument has \del{integer} \ins{integral} type,
then it is effectively cast to \tcode{complex<double>}.
}

Change \eelis{cmplx.over#3} as follows:

\diff{
Function template \tcode{pow} has additional constexpr overloads sufficient to ensure,
for a call with one argument of type \tcode{complex<T1>} and
the other argument of type \tcode{T2} or \tcode{complex<T2>},
both arguments are effectively cast to \tcode{complex<common_type_t<T1, T3>>},
where \tcode{T3} is
\tcode{double} if \tcode{T2} is an \del{integer} \ins{integral} type and \tcode{T2} otherwise.
If \tcode{common_type_t<T1, T3>} is not well-formed,
then the program is ill-formed.
}

Change \eelis{rand.util.seedseq#2} as follows:

\diff{
\constraints
\tcode{T} \del{is an integer type} \ins{models \tcode{integral}}.
}

Change \eelis{rand.util.seedseq#4} as follows:

\diff{
\mandates
\tcode{iterator_traits<InputIterator>::value_type}
\del{is an integer type} \ins{models \tcode{integral}}.
}

Change \eelis{numerics.c.ckdint#1} as follows:

\diff{
\mandates
Each of the types \tcode{type1}, \tcode{type2}, and \tcode{type3}
\del{is a cv-unqualified signed or unsigned integer type}
\ins{models \tcode{integer}}.
}

Change \eelis{cmath.syn#3} as follows:

\diff{
For each function
with at least one parameter of type \placeholder{floating-point-type}
other than \tcode{abs},
the implementation also provides additional overloads sufficient to ensure that,
if every argument corresponding to
a \placeholder{floating-point-type} parameter has arithmetic type,
then every such argument is effectively cast to the floating-point type
with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and
greatest floating-point conversion subrank
among the types of all such arguments,
where arguments of \del{integer} \ins{integral} type are considered to have
the same floating-point conversion rank as \tcode{double}.
If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists,
then overload resolution does not result in
a usable candidate\iref{over.match.general}
from the overloads provided by the implementation.
}

Change \eelis{simd.ctor#7.2} as follows:

\diff{
both \tcode{U} and \tcode{value_type} are integral types and the \del{integer} \ins{integral}
conversion rank\iref{conv.rank} of \tcode{U} is greater than the \del{integer} \ins{integral}
conversion rank of \tcode{value_type}, or
}

Change the title of \eelis{atomics.types.int} as follows:

\diff{
\b{Specializations for \del{integers} \ins{integral types}}
}
