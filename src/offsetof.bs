Abstract: The delegation of the `offsetof` macro semantics to C is problematic.
          I propose to re-define them in C++ without breaking changes to existing code.
</pre>


# Introduction # {#introduction}

Currently, C++ delegates the semantics of `offsetof` to the C standard,
as explained in
<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/support.types.layout#1">\[support.types.layout\] paragraph 1</a>:

> The macro `offsetof(type, member-designator)` has the same semantics
> as the corresponding macro in the C standard library header `<stddef.h>`,
> but accepts a restricted set of type arguments in this document. [...]

Further restrictions and clarifications follow.
However, even with those additional clarifications,
multiple problems arise with the C standard wording when pulled into C++ like this:

## CWG2784. Unclear definition of *member-designator* for `offsetof` ## {#cwg2784}

[[CWG2784]] raises the question whether the following code is valid:
```cpp
struct S {
  int a;
};
int x = offsetof(S, S::a);
```

C requires from the user
(see [7.21 paragraph 3](https://www.iso-9899.info/n3047.html#7.21p3))
that for the macro <code>offsetof(type, <i>member-designator</i>)</code>,
given the declaration `static type t;`:

> the expression `&(t. member-designator)` evaluates to an address constant.

Since there is no *qualified-id* in C,
it is unclear whether `S::a` can be used as a *member-designator*.
MSVC and GCC support this, but clang rejects the code.

All in all, CWG2784 raises three questions:
- Is a *qualified-id* allowed to appear in a *member-designator*?
- Is a *template-id* allowed to appear in a *member-designator*?
- Is an `offsetof` expression a core constant expression?

EWG is soliciting a paper to thoroughly explore the design space.


## Interaction with overloaded `&` operator ## {#interaction-with-overloaded-addressof}

The C wording is also problematic because as stated above,
C requires from the user that

> `&(t. member-designator)` evaluates to an address constant.

It is unclear from normative wording whether the `&` refers to the non-overloaded
`&` operator in C, or the potentially overloaded `&` operator in C++.

<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/support.types.layout#footnote-165">[support.types.layout] footnote 165</a>
states that

> offsetof is required to work as specified even if unary `operator&` is overloaded for any of the types involved.

However, this doesn't clearly answer the question of what `&`
in the C wording means when pulled into C++.
It also isn't normative, and seemingly unsupported by any normative wording.

## Interaction with non-`public` members ## {#interaction-with-non-public-members}

As stated above, C requires that

> `&(t. member-designator)` evaluates to an address constant.

If this expression has semantics defined in C
(without operator overloading and access control),
then a *member-designator* which designates a `private` member should be accepted as well.

However, MSVC, GCC, and Clang reject `offsetof(type, m)` where `m` is a private member.

Note: A class can be standard-layout as long as *all* non-static data members
    have the same access control.

## Undefined behavior for non-default-constructible classes ## {#ub-default-constructible}

As stated above, the C standard describes restrictions given the declaration
`static type t;`.
Obviously, this would not work for non-default-constructible types,
which suggests that `offsetof` has undefined behavior for any class type
that has no accessible default constructor.


# Impact # {#impact}

# Design Considerations # {#design-considerations}

The general approach is to re-define `offsetof` entirely in C++.
The C wording is simply unfit to be pulled into C++ as it is now;
there are too many open questions resulting from this.

Furthermore, the design is is essentially for `offsetof(T, m)`
to give the user the offset of `t.m` (which must be well-formed),
where `t` is an lvalue of type `T`,
and `m` is an *unqualified-id* or *qualified-id* which designates
a non-static data member.

This naturally answers whether a *qualified-id* is allowed,
what role access control plays,
and eliminates questions regarding the overloaded `&` operator.

Modify
<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/diff.offsetof#lib:offsetof">[support.types.layout] paragraph 1</a>
as follows:

<blockquote>
The macro <code>offsetof(<i>type</i>, <i>member-designator</i>)</code>
<del>
has the same semantics as the corresponding macro in the C standard library header <stddef.h>, but accepts a restricted set of type arguments in this document.
</del>
<ins>
expands to a prvalue constant expression of type `size_t`,
the value of which is the offset in bytes, to the subobject
designated by <code><i>member-designator</i></code>,
from the first byte of any object of type <code><i>type</i></code>.
The expresssion is well-formed only if
<ul>
    <li><code><i>type</i></code> is a <i>type-id</i> which denotes a complete class type,</li>
    <li><code><i>member-designator</i></code> is a *qualified-id* or *unqualified-id*, and</li>
    <li>given an lvalue `t` of type <code><i>type</i></code>,
    <code>t.<i>member-designator</i></code> is not a bit-field and
    designates ([expr.ref]) a member subobject of `t`.</li>
</ul>
</ins>
The expression <del><code>offsetof(<i>type</i>, <i>member-designator</i>)</code></del>
is never type-dependent and it is value-dependent if and only if <code><i>type</i></code> is dependent.
<del>The result of applying the offsetof macro to a static data member or a function member is undefined.</del>
No operation invoked by the <del>offsetof macro</del><ins>expression</ins> shall throw an exception
and <code>noexcept(offsetof(<i>type</i>, <i>member-designator</i>))</code> shall be true.
</blockquote>


In Annex C, modify subclause
<a href="https://eel.is/c++draft/diff.offsetof#lib:offsetof">[diff.offsetof] paragraph 1</a>
as follows:

<blockquote>
The macro offsetof, defined in <cstddef>,
accepts a restricted set of type arguments in C++<del>.</del>
<ins>, and supports <code><i>member-designator</i></code>s which would not be valid in C.</ins>
Subclause [support.types.layout] describes the change.
</blockquote>
